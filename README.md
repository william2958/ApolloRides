# ApolloRides

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

This project was initially a way for people to find rideshares across the country. You would be able to post rides you can give as well as search for rides based on destination and time.

Platform was built with Angular 2 Front-end with a Ruby-on-Rails server handling the backend, recording data into a MongoDB database. 

Angular frontend and Rails server were hosted on AWS and the MongoDB was hosted on a separate cloud provider - mLab.

Project was scrapped in July, 2017.
